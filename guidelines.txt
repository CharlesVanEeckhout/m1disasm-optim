use 4 spaces instead of tabs
asm instructions in lowercase
assembler instructions in lowercase
hex numbers in uppercase
labels in camelcase
macros in camelcase
last character in a file must be newline
utf-8

only use asterisk labels for super obvious stuff

tabulation
    general rule is, the more important you are, the less tabs

    branches that form an if structure are tabulated like this

    bne MyLabel
        ; code
    MyLabel:
    ; code

    loops are tabulated like this

    ; code
    MyLabel:
        ; code
        bne MyLabel
    ; code

    if a label is used by multiple branches, no tabs: its an important label
